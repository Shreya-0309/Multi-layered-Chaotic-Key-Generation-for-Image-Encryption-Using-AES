# Multi-layered-Chaotic-Key-Generation-for-Image-Encryption-Using-AES
This is an innovative image encryption algorithm that harnesses the chaotic dynamics of the logistic map and the Lorenz system for key generation, combined with Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) for encryption.
