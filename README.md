# Multi-layered-Chaotic-Key-Generation-for-Image-Encryption-Using-AES
This is an innovative image encryption algorithm that harnesses the chaotic dynamics of the logistic map and the Lorenz system for key generation, combined with Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) for encryption.

The chaotic systems provide a robust and unpredictable source of randomness, enhancing the security of the encryption process. 

The key generation mechanism leverages these chaotic systems to produce a strong encryption key, ensuring data confidentiality. 

The implementation demonstrates the effectiveness of chaotic systems in cryptographic applications, providing a balance between security and efficiency.
